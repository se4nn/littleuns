    <h1>FAQs</h1>
    <p>Below are a few answers to some or our most frequently asked questions</p>
  </section>
  <section class="column faqs">
    <h3>Ingredients and Allergens?</h3>
    <p>On each of the product pages on our website, we have detailed all of the main allergens. We ask you to please state any allergens on order, and please <a href="mailto:tara@littleunscakes.com">contact us</a> if you would like a full ingredients list.</p>
    <p>While we do have processes in place to minimise the risk of cross-contamination, we work in a small kitchen and do not have segregated production areas, so cross-contamination of ingredients is possible.</p>
    <p>All of our cakes are made in an environment where cereals (gluten), diary (milk), eggs, lupin, nuts, peanuts, soya, sesame and sulphites are used. For this reason we cannot guarantee they are free from traces of these allergens.</p>
    <p>If you suffer from a serious allergy, we sadly advise you to not consume any of our products.</p>

    <h3>Vegan?</h3>
    <p>We are pleased to now offer a vegan option on our website, and we hope to grow our selection even further in the near future. We do our best to ensure our vegan products are just as tasty and as high quality as our non-vegan options. Although vegan baking ingredients are more expensive than their dairy alternatives, we are proud to offer our vegan products at the same price as our classic bakes.</p>

    <h3>Gluten Free?</h3>
    <p>We are currently testing, tasting and expanding our gluten free range! If you have a severe gluten allergy, please refer to the above allergen FAQ for more information. Similarly to our vegan alternatives, gluten free baking ingredients are more expensive than their wheat alternatives. However, we are proud to offer all of our gluten free bakes at the same price as our classic options.</p>

    <h3>Order Times?</h3>
    <p>All of our cakes are freshly baked to order so we require a notice period for all orders and deliveries. As we are a small business, it can sometimes take a few days to source ingredients. All orders must be placed the week prior to your desired despatch date, and please note that all orders are despatched every Tuesday and Thursday.</p>
    <p>If you require your bake to be delivered on a certain date, please <a href="mailto:tara@littleunscakes.com">get in touch</a> and we will do our best to accommodate you! All of our bakes are posted via Hermes and can be tracked online (details will be sent to the email address registered with your order.) Typical delivery time is 1-2 days from dispatch, however please be aware that there may be some delays and levels of disruption due to the current global situation.</p>

    <h3>Custom Bakes</h3>
    <p>We also offer cupcakes, loaf cakes and custom birthday cakes for local delivery to postcodes CB10, CB11, CM22, CM23, CM24 and CM6 or collection from CM22. As we are a small team, delivery dates and times are subject to availability and we will always endeavour to accommodate all requests. A longer order notice period also helps to guarantee your slot!</p>
    <p>To see some of the bakes we have on offer, please see our <a href="https://instagram.com/littleunscakes">Instagram</a> and <a href="https://facebook.com/littleunscakes">Facebook</a> pages, and please <a href="mailto:tara@littleunscakes.com">contact us</a> if you would like to order.</p>
    <p>All of our cakes are freshly baked to order using quality ingredients. Please note that all of our cakes are hand-made, therefore photographs are representative and decorations and finishes may vary.</p>
