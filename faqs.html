    <h1>FAQs</h1>
    <p>Below are a few answers to some or our most frequently asked questions</p>
  </section>
  <section class="column faqs">
    <h3>Ingredients and Allergens?</h3>
    <p>On each of the product pages on our website, we have detailed all of the main allergens. We ask you to please state any allergens on order, and please <a href="mailto:tara@littleunscakes.com">contact us</a> if you would like a full ingredients list.</p>
    <p>While we do have processes in place to minimise the risk of cross-contamination, we work in a small kitchen and do not have segregated production areas, so cross-contamination of ingredients is possible.</p>
    <p>All of our cakes are made in an environment where cereals (gluten), diary (milk), eggs, lupin, nuts, peanuts, soya, sesame and sulphites are used. For this reason we cannot guarantee they are free from traces of these allergens.</p>
    <p>If you suffer from a serious allergy, we sadly advise you to not consume any of our products.</p>

    <h3>Vegan?</h3>
    <p>Our Vegan collection will be available online soon, and we hope to grow our selection even further. We do our best to ensure our vegan products are just as tasty and as high quality as our non-vegan options. Although vegan baking ingredients are more expensive than their dairy alternatives, we are proud to offer our vegan products at the same price as our classic bakes.</p>

    <h3>Gluten Free</h3>
    <p>We are currently testing, tasting and expanding our gluten free range! If you have a severe gluten allergy, please refer to the above allergen FAQ for more information. Similarly to our vegan alternatives, gluten free baking ingredients are more expensive than their wheat alternatives. However, we are proud to offer all of our gluten free bakes at the same price as our classic options.</p>

    <h3>Order Times?</h3>
    <p>All of our cakes are freshly baked to order so we require a notice period for all orders and deliveries. As we are a small business, it can sometimes take a few days to source ingredients. We therefore require a two-four day notice period for cupcakes and smaller bakes, and a two week notice for any tall celebration cakes or custom bakes.</p>

    <h3>Deliveries and Drop-Offs</h3>
    <p>We are pleased to currently offer free delivery to postcodes: <strong>CB10, CB11, CM22, CM23, CM24 and CM6</strong>. As we are a small team, delivery dates and times are subject to availability and we will always endeavour to accommodate all requests. A longer order notice period also helps to guarantee your slot!</p>
    <p>For our brownie and bakes postal deliveries, we start preparing our all orders upon receipt of payment and advise that the products should be delivered within 3-5 working days of ordering. All of our brownies are posted first class via Royal Mail, however there may be some delays and levels of disruption due to the current global situation.</p>
